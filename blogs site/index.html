                        <p>Wix is a free website builder tool that can be totally managed from the front-end. 
                            The main characteristic of this platform is that it comes with drag-and-drop options, so you don’t
                             have to handle anything in the back-end. The design is very intuitive and modern,
                              which can be used by both beginners and advanced.</p>
                        <p>The nice thing about Wix is that it has free hosting included,
                             so you just need to arrange the layouts, pick a template, and you’re all set.
                              It provides a nice collection of free and premium themes and templates for 
                              different purposes, including blogging.</p>

                        <h4>2. WordPress (www.wordpress.org)</h4>
                        <p>WordPress.org is the king of free blogging sites. It is a free platform, 
                            but you need to build the site mostly by yourself afterward. You also have
                             to host the software yourself.</p>
                        <p>This is where Bluehost comes into play. Not only is it very cheap 
                            (the Basic plan starts at just $2.75 per month when you sign up for three years),
                             but it also provides solid features, including a free domain name,
                              50GB of disk space, unmetered bandwidth, free SSL, and 100MB of email 
                              storage per account.</p>

                        <p>You probably didn’t see this one coming. LinkedIn isn’t most people’s 
                            first choice when
                             considering which of the free blogging sites to choose.
                             That being said, it really does deserve some attention!</p>
                        <p>About that second thing – the audience – what’s great about
                             LinkedIn’s user base is that those are highly focused users, professionals 
                             and business owners. In fact, it’s reported that more than 
                             30 million businesses are active on LinkedIn. And they’re not just there
                              for the sake of it. Other data indicates that 94% of B2B marketers use 
                              the platform as one of their primary lead sources.</p>

                        <h4>4. Weebly (www.weebly.com)</h4>
                        <p>Weebly is another website builder that you can use not only to blog but also to 
                            sell products or showcase your portfolio. It is somewhat similar to Wix to 
                            the extent that it provides a WYSIWYG editor with drag-and-drop elements.
                             If you want to add a certain button, you can simply drag it to the page and
                              customize it. The same happens with photo galleries, slideshows, and any 
                              other multimedia element.</p>
                        <p>Weebly provides sidebars, media boxes, forms, ad spaces, social media icons, 
                            newsletter subscription, and many more. </p>

                        <h4>5. Medium (www.medium.com)</h4>
                        <p>Medium is a multipurpose platform tackling diverse topics,
                             where anyone with an account can write. Unlike most other free blogging sites,
                              the big advantage of Medium is that your articles will be exposed to a 
                              wide audience since the platform is 
                            visited by 60 million readers (*) per month (and the number increases every year).</p>
                        <p>It’s super simple to use – you pretty much just sign up and start writing.
                             But the downside is that all your content is on Medium. That is, you’re not 
                             really building your own “space” like you would with WordPress. </p>

                        <h4>6. Ghost (www.ghost.org)</h4>
                        <p>This is another WordPress-like blogging platform. While the Ghost software can
                             be downloaded for free, you need paid hosting for fuel. DigitalOcean is a great
                              service that supports Ghost: it is cheap and comes with a bunch of nice 
                              features to get you started.</p>
                        <p>To create a post in Ghost is easy once you set up your website. The editor 
                            is simple and minimalist, and it offers a live preview of your text on the 
                            right side of the screen. On the front-end, you get a Medium vibe, so it’s nice. 
                            Near the editor screen, there is a sidebar with settings, where you can choose
                             your preferences.</p>

                        <p>It’s a solid solution for personal blogs, but it’s not the best resource for
                            professional use. It works just like the other hosted platforms: 
                            you need to create an account first in order to use it.
                             After you create it (which is simple), you have to pick one of the default
                              themes and you can start writing your thoughts down. This platform has
                               an interface similar to a Google+ profile and the editor looks like
                                a Word page.</p>
                        <p>Blogger delivers a bunch of themes to choose from, each providing different skins,
                            advanced color filtering, and various minimalist gadgets (aka widgets). </p>

                        <p>Tumblr is one of the original free blogging sites on the web.
                             It’s just a bit ‘milder’ than the others on the list. Unlike the
                              rest of the platforms that are mostly created for publishing purposes,
                               this one here is more oriented to multimedia or social media-like content.
                                The interface of Tumblr is more playful and is easy to get
                                 started with – you can simply sign up and then you’re allowed to
                                  start posting.</p>
                        <p>Just like a regular blogging platform, it provides multiple post formats for
                             different types of content. The thing with Tumblr is that it is purely
                              for personal use and wouldn’t put up a great solution 
                              if you have business-oriented plans.</p>

                        <p>Joomla is similar to WordPress.org but not as obvious when considering
                            the free blog sites available out there. Just like WordPress, the software 
                            is free but needs hosting and a domain. As in the WordPress case, we recommend
                             Bluehost because it is both very cheap and reliable (and it includes a free domain).</p>
                        <p>In general, Joomla has a flexible interface that can be used not
                             only for blogs but also for more complex websites (you can choose
                              from a variety of templates and extensions to add custom functionality).</p>

                        <p>Jimdo is more than just an example of free blogging sites.
                             However, in its free version, blogs are the most recommended,
                              given Jimdo’s basic features. So you can quickly create a website
                               with Jimdo by going through a few items (you take a basic 
                               questionnaire about your site’s purpose). After you check these options,
                                your site is automatically created based on your picks. The downside
                                 of Jimdo is that you can’t have a custom domain (at least not for free)
                                  and you can’t remove the ads unless you upgrade.</p>
                        <p>An important aspect of Jimdo, though, is that it is a page builder: </p>
